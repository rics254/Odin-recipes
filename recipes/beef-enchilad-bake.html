    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This beef enchilada bake with chili beans, bell pepper, and cheese is easy to assemble and bakes quickly enough to make a great family-friendly weeknight dinner.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 large bell pepper, any color, diced</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can red enchilada sauce, divided</li>
        <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>12 ounces Mexican blend shredded cheese</li>
        <li>cilantro, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>sour cream, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil, then add onions. Sauté until onions just start to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add bell pepper; sauté 1 to 2 minutes. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef; cook, breaking up beef with a spatula, until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain any grease. Stir in chili beans. Season with salt, black pepper, and cumin. Stir in 1 cup enchilada sauce, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, spread remaining enchilada sauce evenly in the bottom of a 10x8-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, carefully cut a straight edge off one side of the tortillas. Place 4 tortillas with the cut edge facing the sides of the dish.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the beef mixture over tortillas and top with 3 ounces cheese. Add another layer of tortillas, then beef mixture and 3 ounces cheese to create the second layer. Repeat layers ending with remaining cheese. Cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove foil; bake until cheese is lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven; allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with sour cream and chopped cilantro if desired.</li>
    </ol>
